# Creating a bash script to make lab7 tasks faster

## I didn't know the control + r command at that time. Therefore, I failed horribly and it took me more than 15 minutes. So, I decided to write a bash script

## step 1) loggin in to the remote account
 * First I press `ctrl+r,` type `ss,` and press `enter` on my username

## step 2) Then I type `nano quick.bash` which opens the nano editor where I can write my bash script.
* I follow all the steps till compiling and running the program. Here is the screenshot of the bash script.

* And here is the screen of the working bash script after I typed `bash quick.sh`

* The above screenshot shows that it fails the tests.

## step 3) Now I type `nano lab7/ListExamples.java` fix the code

## steo 4) now we write a another bash script called `quick2.sh`
* This script will push all the code with corrected output to the remote account.
